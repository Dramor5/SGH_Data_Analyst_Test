# SGH_Data_Analyst_Test
 This contains the dataset and Rmarkdown file for the data analyst technical test. The knitted .html file output of the Rmd is also provided, in case there are difficulties in running the file. Feel free to reach out to me if you face difficulties in viewing the output. 

 I was successful in running the code by downloading the repository as a .zip file, unzipping it, and running the Rmd directly from the folder on my other computer.
